#### About

<p>I am self-made Frontend Developer, pasionate and motivated. I have an experience as a Web designer. In March, 2021 I finished an intensive coding bootcamp, focusing on JavaScript and React.js. For the last 3 months I've been working as a Full stack web developer for an e-learning muscical platform covering the MERN stack. I enjoy working in a team, solving problems, learning new things. This is why a Web developer job is my dream job.</p>
